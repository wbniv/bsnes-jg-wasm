6edc1c3	body	Disproved bitwise wasm reproducibility across hosts: emcc 6.0.1 from\nidentical pinned inputs (tarball sha256, EMSDK_VERSION, unchanged build.sh)\nproduces byte-different wasm locally vs on the GH runner — the two rebuilds\ndiverge from each other at the same structural byte (a stack/global\ninitializer), so this is host-dependent codegen/layout, not input drift.\n\nNew gate: JS glue (ABI) + app.js byte-identical, wasm size within 1%, and\nthe differential gate's WRAM CRC must PASS on BOTH the rebuilt core and the\ncommitted dist engine. publish.yml verifies the CRC on the committed engine\n(what npm actually ships).\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>\nClaude-Session: https://claude.ai/code/session_011DEG8ouwAWtqeWtcvZSysz

85462bc	body	Base is biohack.net's copy (fullscreen controller, poster clear-to-black).\nTwo deliberate changes on top:\n\n- yoff: KEEP the adaptive 'h >= 232 ? 8 : 0' and supersede aaacbae's yoff=0.\n  Measured per-row on this build (deterministic frames after _bjg_reset):\n  the 512x240 buffer carries content in rows [8,232) — blossom @900 spans\n  8..221, mandel-display @1500 spans 8..232. yoff=0 adds an 8px black band\n  and crops up to 9 content rows off the bottom; aaacbae's 'flush at buffer\n  top' rationale described the headless jgxcheck capture, not this buffer.\n\n- touch nav: the lzss-gallery chevron hit-test is no longer hardcoded to a\n  slug; a ROM opts in via manifest 'touchNav': {left:[x,y,w,h], right:[...]}.\n  Verified live: chevron taps hit, artwork taps stay inert.\n\nThe 'keep both site copies byte-identical' invariant dies here — sites will\nvendor this file via the sync CLI (see docs/plans/2026-07-27-npm-player-package.md).\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>\nClaude-Session: https://claude.ai/code/session_011DEG8ouwAWtqeWtcvZSysz
