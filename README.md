# bsnes-jg-wasm

**The cycle-accurate SNES core that gates a compiler's correctness — now in your browser.**

A WebAssembly build of [**bsnes-jg 2.1.0**](https://gitlab.com/jgemu/bsnes) (the Jolly Good fork of
bsnes), plus a minimal page that runs `.sfc` homebrew. Its reason to exist: bsnes-jg is the
**second leg of the differential gate** in the [`llvm-mos-65816`](https://github.com/wbniv/llvm-mos-65816)
project (a from-source LLVM fork adding native 16-bit-accumulator codegen — `+mos-a16` — for the
WDC 65816). That gate asserts *host == default@MAME == +mos-a16@MAME == +mos-a16@bsnes-jg*. By
shipping **the same core** — the exact `2.1.0` tarball the gate pins, by version *and* sha256 — a
browser demo of the `+mos-a16` ROMs is byte-for-byte the output the gate already verified, not a
snes9x lookalike. The page proves it: a **Verify fidelity** button reproduces the gate's headless
WRAM assert (`mandel-display` → `0x9103`) live in the tab.

> **Why bsnes-jg and not snes9x?** snes9x is the turnkey browser default, but it is *not*
> cycle-accurate and its license is **non-commercial / GPL-incompatible**. bsnes-jg is
> **cycle-accurate AND GPLv3** — the accuracy-matched *and* license-clean choice. The only cost is
> one Emscripten core build, which `build.sh` owns.

## The npm package — `@wbniv/bsnes-jg-player`

This repo doubles as an npm package so any site can vendor the player without touching Emscripten:

```sh
npm i @wbniv/bsnes-jg-player          # or: npm i git+https://github.com/wbniv/bsnes-jg-wasm.git
npx bsnes-jg-player sync public/play  # vendor app.js + cores/* (+ ENGINE_VERSION stamp)
npx bsnes-jg-player sync public/play --demo   # also seed the mandel-display demo ROM
```

`sync` never touches `roms/` or `preview/` (your site's content) unless `--demo`. In CI, run
`npx bsnes-jg-player sync --check public/play` — it exits 1 if the vendored engine drifts from the
installed package version (byte-for-byte sha256), which replaces any "keep the copies identical by
hand" discipline. `dist/` (the published payload) is **committed**: CI rebuilds the core from source
and diffs it against `dist/engine/cores/`, so publishes never wait on an emsdk build and a git-URL
install works.

**Astro sites** get a component and an optional build-time warning light:

```astro
---
import SnesPlayer from '@wbniv/bsnes-jg-player/SnesPlayer.astro';
---
<SnesPlayer slug="my-rom" title="My ROM" keys="Arrows: pan · Z: fire." />
```

```js
// astro.config.mjs — warns (or mode:'error' fails) when public/play predates the package
import bsnesPlayer from '@wbniv/bsnes-jg-player/integration';
export default defineConfig({ integrations: [bsnesPlayer()] });
```

**Any other stack**: copy the documented block from [`embed/snippet.html`](embed/snippet.html) +
[`embed/player.css`](embed/player.css).

### Boot contract (what `app.js` reads)

| Surface | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `window.BJG_BASE` | URL base of the play dir, with trailing slash (default `''` = relative) |
| `window.BJG_DEFAULT_ROM` | ROM id to boot (a `?rom=` query param wins) |
| `window.BJG_BUST` | optional `{relpath: shortsha}` map → `?v=` immutable-cache busting |
| `#screen` | the 256×224 canvas (required) |
| `#status` `#checkresult` `#verify` `#banner` `#fullscreen` `#game` | status line · fidelity badge · self-check button · errors/provenance · fullscreen button · drag-drop wrapper (all optional) |
| manifest `selfcheck` | `{off,len,want,frames,label}` — powers **Verify fidelity** (run N frames, assert WRAM) |
| manifest `touchNav` | `{left:[x,y,w,h], right:[x,y,w,h]}` — canvas taps press pad Left/Right (for ROMs drawing their own chevrons) |

Keyboard map (fixed): arrows = D-pad, `Z`/`X` = B/A, `A`/`S` = Y/X, `Q`/`W` = L/R, `Enter` = Start,
`Shift` = Select.

## Quick start

```sh
task build          # bootstrap emsdk + build the bsnes-jg wasm core into web/cores/  (slow first run)
task serve          # serve web/ on http://localhost:8000
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), pick a demo (or drop your own `.sfc`), and hit
**Verify fidelity** to watch the in-browser self-check land the gate's `0x9103`. (If you haven't run
`build.sh`, the page says so instead of erroring.)

`emsdk` is bootstrapped automatically if `emcc` isn't on `PATH`. First run is slow (downloads the
Emscripten toolchain + builds the core); after that it's cached.

Keys: arrows = d-pad, `Z`/`X` = B/A, `A`/`S` = Y/X, `Enter` Start, `Shift` Select, `Q`/`W` = L/R.

## How "same core" is made literal

- **The pin.** `build.sh` fetches the **`gitlab.com/jgemu/bsnes` 2.1.0** tarball and checks its
  sha256 against the value pinned in `llvm-mos-65816/dev/xcheck.sh` — the exact bytes the gate
  builds. (Not `libretro/bsnes-jg`; that's a different repo. See the plan's Decisions §4.)
- **The frontend.** `web/src/main.cpp` drives the same `Bsnes::` C++ API the gate's headless harness
  (`dev/jgxcheck.cpp`) uses — `load`/`power`/`run`, `getMemoryRaw(MainRAM)` — so the page can read
  WRAM and assert the gate's value. No libretro, no EmulatorJS.
- **The wasm wrinkle.** bsnes-jg threads cooperatively via libco, which has no WebAssembly code path;
  `web/src/libco_emscripten.c` reimplements it on Emscripten fibers (the build links `-sASYNCIFY`).
- **The proof.** The **Verify fidelity** button powers on `mandel-display`, runs 1000 frames, reads
  WRAM `$0580`, and shows `0x9103 == gate`. That's the gate's own assert, in a browser tab.

## License

The bsnes-jg core is **GPLv3** (`LICENSE` is its verbatim `COPYING`). Anything that links or ships
the built core inherits GPLv3 — so this repo, and any deploy of `web/cores/*.wasm`, publishes its
source. The build scripts and loader here are GPLv3 to match. See `NOTICE` for attribution. The
bundled `.sfc` files are homebrew built by the `llvm-mos-65816` toolchain from its own example
sources.

## Not a CI test leg

This runs the *same* cores the `llvm-mos-65816` gate already runs natively (MAME + bsnes-jg), only
slower and harder to drive headless. It adds **no** correctness coverage and is deliberately **not**
wired into that project's differential gate. It exists to *show*, not to *verify*.
